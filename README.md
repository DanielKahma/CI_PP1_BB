# Content
- The content in this project is fictional, it is a project i came up with, with the help of inspiration from a lot of different places.

- I have always wanted to try a Burger challenge but have never gotten the chance, thats why i included it in my website.

- Everything written on the website is made up by me.

- Social media icons in the Footer of the website is taken from Font Awesome, as well as the "bars" and "close" icons used for the responsive menu in the top right corner


# Design
- As this is my first project ever, i have learned a lot, i got to play around and test different ideas which was really fun, i really enjoyed this project.

- My goal was to do the best i could with the limited knowledge i had and i think it was successful in making a good looking website
